			"createSimulator": {
				"question": "How does WiseTrainer simulator creation work?",
				"answer": "The process is simple: 1) Request a quote to define your needs, 2) Send photos of your facilities (or on-site scan by our team), 3) 3D modeling in collaboration with your business experts, 4) Co-creation of pedagogical scenarios, 5) Delivery in about 1 month."
			},
			"assetOwnership": {
				"question": "Who owns the 3D asset created for my company?",
				"answer": "The 3D environment custom-built for your company belongs to you 100%. You own the digital asset created from your facilities. It's your investment, your intellectual property."
			},
			"scenarioTypes": {
				"question": "What types of scenarios can be created?",
				"answer": "We offer two ranges: Safe (safety) for safety procedures, emergency gestures, PPE use, fire evacuation, chemical leaks; and Tech (maintenance) for maintenance operations, fault diagnosis, lockout/tagout. Each environment includes 3 base scenarios."
			},
			"hybridTraining": {
				"question": "Is WiseTwin compatible with in-person training?",
				"answer": "Yes! Even though there's no native \"group\" feature yet, you can run in-person sessions with WiseTwin. Equip your learners with tablets and lead a WisePaper course with a facilitator who expands on the content in real-time while each participant answers quizzes on their device."
			},
			"technicalRequirements": {
				"question": "What are the technical requirements to use WiseTwin?",
				"answer": "WiseTwin is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The only technical requirement is WebGL support to display 3D environments. A good internet connection is recommended for quickly loading WiseTrainer simulators."
			},
			"gdprCompliance": {
				"question": "How is my learners' data protected?",
				"answer": "WiseTwin is 100% GDPR compliant. All your data is hosted on European servers: we use Neon for databases and Azure for Unity builds of 3D simulators. Your data never leaves Europe."
			},
			"freeTrial": {
				"question": "Is there a free trial period?",
				"answer": "The platform is completely free during your training development phase. You only move to a paid plan when your learners actually start training. This allows you to take the time to create your content with no commitment."
